STEAM Who? - Guess the Famous Personality Game

## Introduction
During the e-learning sessions, the basic concepts of JavaScript were learned to undertake this project. The program is designed to guess famous characters from the STEAM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) by asking a series of yes/no questions.

---

## Project Description
The web application asks the user to mentally choose a famous STEAM character from a provided list. The system then poses a series of yes/no questions to narrow down the possibilities and eventually guess the selected character.

---

## Project Structure

- **index.html** — main page containing the entire program and user interface.
- **manuale_utente.pdf** — user manual explaining how to use the program, including flow charts or pseudocode.
- **css/** — folder containing stylesheet files.
- **img/** — folder containing any images used.
- Other folders/files as needed for additional resources.

## Development Steps

### 1. Analysis
- Carefully analyze the project requirements.
- Create a flow chart or pseudocode to describe the algorithm used to guess the character.
- Prepare a list of at least 20 famous STEAM characters with details (birth year, field, awards, etc.) to base the questions on.

### 2. Coding
- Implement the project using JavaScript embedded within a single HTML page (**index.html**).
- Use any libraries or CSS frameworks desired to enhance design and usability.
- Organize files into clear folders and maintain a tidy project structure.

### 3. Testing
- Test the application thoroughly to fix any bugs and ensure proper functionality.
- Verify that the system correctly guesses the character and handles all possible answer sequences.

### 4. Delivery
- Create the user manual PDF (**manuale_utente.pdf**) including instructions and the algorithm’s flow chart or pseudocode.
- Package the project folder into a ZIP file containing all necessary files.
- Upload the ZIP file to the e-learning platform.

## Functional Requirements
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Series of questions answered only with "Yes" or "No".
- Algorithm that narrows down options to guess the character.
- Support for at least 20 different characters.
- Ability to reset and start a new game.
- Step counter showing how many questions were asked.
- Responsive design, optionally using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.

---

## Important Notes
- The **index.html** file must be the single entry point for the project.
- The project folder must be well organized and clearly named.
- All files necessary for the project to work must be included in the ZIP file.
- The user manual PDF is mandatory for evaluation.
